# SENG-321 Requirements Engineering

As a part of a team, working with A.A., B.K. and T.M., we contributed equally to a Requirements Document/Specification for an cetacean observation system.

I worked on all aspects of the document, including the:

- Introduction
- Overall Description
- System Features
- External Interface Requirements
- Other Non-Functional Requirements
- Other Requirements
- Use Cases
- Data Flow Diagrams
- User Interface
- Appendix

The work that our team did was of high quality and I am pleased to say it was the best team I worked with during my university career.
